Installation Notes: 

On 32-bit versions of Windows:
 - Just run Max5.msi
 - Reboot

On 64-bit versions of windows:
 - Run "PACE Drivers x64.exe" (Not necessary if you have it already by ProTools HD 10.3.5 or others)
 - Run Max5.msi
 - Reboot


Do not forget to overwrite the original files with the cracked ones (Lz0 Folder)

Known issue with this release of MAX :

- You cannot overwrite a project save if it has the same name,
CAUTION WHILE YOU CLOSE THE PROJECT, SAVE CHANGES DOESNT WORK, IT WONT BE SAVED THAT WAY.
So just rename it (save as) ! (Or it will throw you a jpatcher_saveto: error -1 shit)


(PS: Asio4All works like a charm with MAX, dont forget to download it and 
Set it as the audio driver in Options, Dsp Status)
